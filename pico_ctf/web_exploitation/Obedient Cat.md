  Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.

```shell
└─$ Enter Command Here
```

To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: 
  
  ```shell
  └─$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/217686fc11d733b80be62dcfcfca6c75/flag
  ```

To get more information on the 'cat' command use the following: 
  
  ```shell
 └─$ man cat
  ```

1) Using our terminal we can download the flag, but how do we view the contents from the terminal? There are a few text editors that are preinstalled such as vim or nano, but in this instance CAT (concatenate) will do. First we need to download the file using wget or curl.

```shell
 └─$  wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/217686fc11d733b80be62dcfcfca6c75/flag
```
2) Making sure we have the file using LS to check the current directory listing.
```shell
└─$  ls
flag
```
3) Read the flag using cat.
```shell
└─$  cat flag
picoCTF{REDACTED}
```
Alternatively you could simply use the GUI and download the file manually and open it via any text editor, it is in the clear after all.
