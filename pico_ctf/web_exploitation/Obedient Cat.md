1) Using our terminal we can download the flag, but how do we view the contents from the terminal? There are a few text editors that are preinstalled such as vim or nano, but in this instance cat will do. First we need to download the file using wget or curl.

```shell
 └─$  wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/217686fc11d733b80be62dcfcfca6c75/flag
```
2) Making sure we have the file using LS to check the current directory listing.
```shell
└─$  ls
flag
```
3) Read the flag using cat.
```shell
└─$  cat flag
picoCTF{REDACTED}
```
